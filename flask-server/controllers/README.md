# /controllers
- This directory holds the controller logic. Export functions to be used inside `server.py`
- I think it is better to create 1 file for 1 functionality.
- See `get_users.py` file for reference.

## Naming Convention
- should use snake_case
- all lower_case
- file name should be the same with the function name
